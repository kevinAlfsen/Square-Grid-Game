# Square-Grid-Game

This is an ongoing project very early in development

The plan is for this to become an isometric resource management game

Currently working on making a square grid for the playing field as well as a level editor. The grid is made using a singe mesh. Grid generation is based on a tutorial by CatLikeCoding : https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map
